The Case of the Golden Idol

https://mikesub.net/blog/peek-poke.html
I still love games, even though I don’t play. I value the imaginative, immersive worlds they could offer — like a good book. The kind that makes your brain do the rendering. But today’s big titles chase realism. Now real actors play roles. We’ve moved from books to movies. One isn’t better — just different. But books undeniably ask more of your imagination. They hint at worlds, rather than showing you their version of everything.
Back then, you didn’t have a choice — you might’ve wanted cinematic, but hardware couldn’t handle it. But now you have it: symbolic or realistic. And while the mainstream tends toward realism, the symbolic hasn’t vanished — both exist!

hmm. now share your thoughts on this: now hardware is way better and of course it unlocked many game technics and overall graphics which were not possible. also because of memory and cpu - parts which are not dependent on graphics - for example enemy AI logic now could be more sophisticated. at the same time now we see some games which are really lofi and could easily be implemented on early days hardware (into the breach, balatro, braid (with lower graphics but still its just a platformer) — all of these happened now, only now. while back then there was no limits to do smth similar. Did we need these decades of game development to evolve into such games or there is smth else behind this?

The Paradox of Simple Games in Complex Times
You're right - it's fascinating! Games like Into the Breach could've been made in 1992 with simpler graphics.
What really changed:
Design maturity:

Decades of failed experiments taught us what's fun vs what's just complex
Roguelike revival - learned that procedural + simple rules = infinite depth
Indie movement - small teams focusing on core mechanics, not tech showcase

Cultural shifts:

90s mindset: "Use every byte, push hardware limits!"
2020s mindset: "What's the purest, most elegant experience?"
Mobile influence - forced designers to think in simple interactions

Economic factors:

90s: Graphics sold games, magazines reviewed polygon counts
Now: Steam/mobile stores flooded - gameplay matters more than graphics
Development costs - AAA games cost $100M+, indies can succeed with pixel art

Tools and iteration:

Unity/Godot - prototype in hours, not months
Rapid iteration - playtest, tweak, repeat daily
Game design theory - we understand flow states, difficulty curves, engagement loops

The real insight: We needed hardware power to experiment freely. In the 90s, every feature was expensive. Now you can try 100 mechanics and keep the best one.
Braid example: Jonathan Blow could focus purely on time manipulation mechanics because he didn't have to fight memory constraints or optimize rendering.
Constraints breed creativity, but freedom breeds experimentation - and experimentation eventually finds elegance.
