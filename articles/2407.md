Quitting social media is like quitting smoking — it's easy, I've done it several times already. And those channels in instant messaging (IM) apps can be even worse. You can delete X, but you keep IMs.

However, there are scenarios where IM “blogs” fit really well. And yes, the key is to make them feel like IM. It shouldn't be a constant stream of updates to hold your attention, but occasional private updates to a group. Such are fun. Let’s have more of those! I even have one myself: [https://t.me/transmith](https://t.me/transmith) Share yours!

E-mail correspondence I suggested in my previous update didn’t really work out. Not that I expected it to. I don’t blame you.

Here are some links I found interesting recently:
* [A story](https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/should-this-be-a-map-or-500-maps) how on 1700s Spanish King ordered to an accurate map of the kingdom and that resulted in 500 different maps.
* [WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale](https://www.sanfordhealthplan.com/-/media/files/documents/providers/clinical-resources/cms-quality-adult_adhd_self_report_screener_new_2012.pdf)
