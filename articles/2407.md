Quitting social media is like quitting smoking — easy, done it several times.

E-mail correspondence I suggested in my previous update didn’t really work out. Not that I expected it to. So here are some links I found interesting recently:
* [A story](https://escapethealgorithm.substack.com/p/should-this-be-a-map-or-500-maps) how on 1700s Spanish King ordered to an accurate map of the kingdom and that resulted in 500 different maps.
* [WHO Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale](https://www.sanfordhealthplan.com/-/media/files/documents/providers/clinical-resources/cms-quality-adult_adhd_self_report_screener_new_2012.pdf)
