I've just realised that [Joanne Dvorak](https://www.theolognion.com/programmer-starts-a-blog-doesnt-write-about-their-static-site-generator-setup-in-the-first-post/) might be not the only one to make this mistake.

So let me fix it. I've never been a fan of write-your-own-thing when there are many superior alternatives available. Now I’m even less of it. But when I decided to spin up a stand-alone blog, I didn’t go for Hugo, Gatsby or Jekyll. I thought it’s just a bunch of static pages, right. If you add some basic scripts for automation so you don’t need to update an RSS file manually and don’t copy-paste an HTML header, you should end up in less than a hundred lines of code. That probably should take less than reading through docs and configuring something ready-made. Well, I’ve ended up in [~150](https://github.com/mikesub/mikesub.net/tree/master/src). 

< Note on Testing.  >

It comes with a dark mode, human date formatting, drafts, RSS, JSONFeed.

As for the deploy,  and publishing by git push. hosting comes for free from GitHub atm. 

The only thing I’m paying for is the domain name.
It misses a favicon, I'll make it eventually. Also I planned to add tags when I got enough posts, but with the current pace I have few years for that.

Now you know.
