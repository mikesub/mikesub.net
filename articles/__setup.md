I've just realised that [Joanne Dvorak](https://www.theolognion.com/programmer-starts-a-blog-doesnt-write-about-their-static-site-generator-setup-in-the-first-post/) might be not the only one to make such mistake.

So let me fix it. I've never been a fan of write-your-own-thing when there are many superior alternatives available. Now I’m even less of it. But when I decided to spin up a stand-alone blog, I didn’t go for Hugo, Gatsby, Jekyll or Ghost. I thought it’s just a bunch of static pages, right. If you add some basic scripts for automation so you don’t write a RSS file manually and don’t copy-paste a HTML header, you should end up in less than hundred lines of code. That probably should take less that reading through docs and configuring something ready-made. Well, I’ve ended up in [~150](https://github.com/mikesub/mikesub.net/tree/master/src). 

It comes with a dark mode, human date formatting, drafts, RSS, JSONFeed and publishing by git push. The only thing I miss is favicon, but I'll draw it eventually. The only thing I’m paying for is the domain name, it’s being hosted for free by GitHub.

Now you know.
