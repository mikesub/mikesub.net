<p>No updates here for a long time. And 2023 has ended, so why not to journal some results. Then I saw others&#39; posts online and realized I would be writing roughly the same, and for some reason, it stopped me. Then, having found no rationale why not to, I thought it still was worth writing about the disenchantment which feels now not transient but getting deeply rooted.</p>
<p>It probably all began during the pandemic, with disenchantment in governments and states in general. Then it was affirmed and intensified due to the war. This year, I keenly felt it from social media and from the internet. At some point, I realized that I gain no interest and knowledge reading my RSS subscriptions, with rare exceptions. I didn&#39;t renew my FeedBin and didn&#39;t notice much difference. I did transfer a couple of subscriptions to email and that&#39;s it. I tried to read books and listen to audio versions more. Not a strong habit yet but feels much better in comparison.</p>
<p>Also, I decided to try to transform email into what it used to be. You receive a letter, sometimes a long one, and you read it with interest, instead of an impersonal stream of spam in the form of updates for the sake of updates and news for attention-grabbing.
Simultaneously, I took a break from Twitter, which was the only social media I used. In the beginning, I tried moving to Mastodon, found no one there, and eventually quit both.
But to feel all this more vividly, I had to return to Twitter in December to sense this contrast. What a place!</p>
<p>At the same time, there are no hopes and expectations for 2024. As Dan The Stranger said, at best, it will be average. The only thing I find interesting to follow now is Argentina, but as they reminded us recently on the Reason podcast: all politicians are garbage and will disappoint you in the end.</p>
<p>So how about your 2023 and 2024 plans? Let&#39;s start a correspondence?</p>
