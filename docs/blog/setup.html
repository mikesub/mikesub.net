    <p>I&#39;ve just realised that <a href="https://www.theolognion.com/programmer-starts-a-blog-doesnt-write-about-their-static-site-generator-setup-in-the-first-post/">Joanne Dvorak</a> might be not the only one to make such mistake.</p>
<p>So let me fix it. I&#39;ve never been a fan of write-your-own-thing when there are many superior alternatives available. Now I’m even less of it. But when I decided to spin up a stand-alone blog, I didn’t go for Hugo, Gatsby or Jekyll. I thought it’s just a bunch of static pages, right. If you add some basic scripts for automation so you don’t need to update a RSS file manually and don’t copy-paste a HTML header, you should end up in less than a hundred lines of code. That probably should take less than reading through docs and configuring something ready-made. Well, I’ve ended up in <a href="https://github.com/mikesub/mikesub.net/tree/master/src">~150</a>.</p>
<p>To be fair, it has dependencies on Date-fns, Lodash, Mustache and Meta-marked. In theory, I could have gone without first two. That would increase the size, of course. Mustache and Meta-marked (a markdown library) is harder to remove but at the same time I could make it as an independent external process in the build system, not depending on node-modules implementation. It seems to be an overkill, I&#39;m not a purist in this regard.</p>
<p>One thing I&#39;m very pleased with is how tests are done. There are none of them. I&#39;ve just made it work once by manual testing, then results (htmls and feeds) got pushed to Git and from that moment I just re-run builds and check Git diff. No changes, no regression. I like it. Snapshot testing, haha.</p>
<p>The blog comes with a dark mode, human date formatting, drafts, RSS and JSONFeed.</p>
<p>As for the deploy, I just push changes to GitHub. Hosting comes for free from GitHub at the moment. The only thing I’m paying for is the domain name.</p>
<p>It misses a favicon, I&#39;ll make it eventually. Also I planned to add tags when I got enough posts, but with the current pace I have few more years for that.</p>
<p>Now you know.</p>
