<p>There is no better than to start from 2005. I borrowed a <a href="https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/minoltadimagea1">Minolta DiMAGE A1</a> from a friend and started shooting. That was my first exposure into digital photography and photography in general apart from few episodes in my childhood.</p>
<p>Obviously, there is nothing worth sharing from these times, now it all seems very primitive and full of mistakes, but that was arguably the most exciting time: constant learning, a-ha moments, experiments, not knowing a thing, that was fantastic.</p>
<p>And this is a shot of a man on a escalator in Moscow metro. The original was lost, all I have this 600x450 processed for web. But that might be even better, that shows that all I knew at that moment was a pair of brightness and contrast sliders.</p>
