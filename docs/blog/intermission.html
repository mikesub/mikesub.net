<p>Obviously, it turned out harder than expected. My plans to go through all my photos year by year stalled on year #2 (2006).
I haven&#39;t picked a photo and finished the note but already have an external HDD dead, recovered data from backups,
disassembled proprietory photo libraries, found a way to export photos from Lightroom CC (which doesn&#39;t have Export
option), removed dedupes after merging inconsistently structured backups (better than none) and so on.</p>
<p>Computers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, new photos keep appearing. This one I&#39;ve just taken yesterday. It&#39;s probably too early to share it
but I feel the need to fill that intermission.</p>
