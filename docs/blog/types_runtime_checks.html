    <p>That&#39;s the second article in a series on TypeScript started by ‘<a href="ts_bad_parts.html">TypeScript. Bad Parts</a>’. You can read them in any order as they aren&#39;t really connected apart from covering the same topic. But if you can&#39;t decide, make it <a href="ts_bad_parts.html">chronologically</a>.</p>
<p>So what do types bring to JS? They fix some bad parts of JS, but that&#39;s a byproduct. Mainly they add some semantics to code which helps editors and people to get more sense what it&#39;s doing, how it should work and also spot some things which can be optimised. Let me show-case that with several examples.</p>
<h2 id="runtime-checks">Runtime checks</h2>
<p>Say, we have a function which takes a configuration object, which is a JS way to have named arguments, and it really needs <code>url</code> out of it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function main({ url }) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>It can not do a thing without <code>url</code>, no fallback or default value possible. So there are two options, either to exit silently returning <code>undefined</code> or, to make it more explicit, to throw an error:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function main({ url }) {
  if (!url) {
    throw new Error(&quot;no URL provided&quot;);
  }
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>That should work. If somebody fails to put URL there, they notice it ASAP. But since it&#39;s not really named arguments there but just a fake, the code might fail even before. If one doesn&#39;t provide an object at all, we&#39;ll get:</p>
<pre><code>TypeError: Cannot destructure property `url` of &#39;undefined&#39; or &#39;null&#39;.
</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s not discuss the fact that my Chrome can&#39;t decide what it gets there: null or undefined, and try to fix that.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">function main({ url } = {}) {
  if (!url) {
    throw new Error(&quot;no URL provided&quot;);
  }
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now it&#39;s better. Though now it looks stupid. We&#39;ve just provided a fallback value to be able to throw an error which can not be caught and recovered from.</p>
<p>And that&#39;s all happening in runtime. The code is there: parsed, evaluated, running, though isn&#39;t helping at all. If you use type annotations you can prevent that thing before runtime.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-typescript">function main({ url }: { url: string }) {
  // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of providing a default value and throwing an error, we state that the argument is required and it needs to have <code>url</code> key which is a string. That&#39;s not ideal as any string, even empty one, will pass. But TypeScript might evolve to it at some point: <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6579">regex-validated string type</a>. And as of now, we&#39;re already preventing some errors w/o any runtime costs.</p>
