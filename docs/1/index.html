        <p>All my experience with photography has been digital. I got film cameras several times but always sold it back after few months.
        In 2017 I stumbled upon a full darkroom set for sale and decided to experience it all. It costed almost nothing and contained everything you might need. There was even film in bulk rolls and few cassettes. But then it had to wait for two more years in my storage room.</p><p>
        I started with a bulk roll can marked Ilford FP4 (without plus) which I knew nothing about. Wikipedia says it was discontinued in 1990. I didn’t even know whether it had film inside or not. I barricaded in my bathroom and opened a can. There was film but I couldn’t tell how much of the original 17 meters. And I was not sure was it FP4 and how expired it was. Without any precision, spreading my arms to measure the length, I loaded a cassette.</p><p>
        It was February 2020, one more month and the WHO declared the pandemic.</p><p>
        I’m not a quick shooter, even for testing purposes it took me several weeks to finish the first roll. During all that time I was not sure what I was shooting on. The untested camera gave me doubts too. Then it came to development which neither I have much experience nor it was clear how to develop that expired film. But in the end, I got images. It was FP4 indeed, ISO was right, the camera worked, Rodinal did its job, countries were locking down.</p><p>
        The following two years I was slowly shooting that bulk roll. When it ended, I picked these to illustrate this period.
