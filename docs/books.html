        The Making of a Manager: What to Do When Everyone Looks to You,
        <small style="white-space:nowrap"><i>by Julie Zhuo</i></small>
      </h2>
      <p>
        ★★★★☆ A nice compilation of tips and tricks for the first-time managers.
        The author is a designer manager at Facebook. At the beginning I saved
        few quotes but most of the book I read diagonally. Nevertheless I'd
        recommend it if you're looking to read something on the topic and it
        sounds relevant to you: 1:1s, meetings, giving feedback, etc.

        In late 90s and early 2000s I read quite a lot. Mainly it was 19th and
        20th century classics, counterculture, science fiction. Then at some
        point I stopped. A couple of books a month dropped to one-two a good
        year. Since then I had few attempts to start reading again but it didn't
        get further than a book or two. Then I decided to log books I read and
        you're looking at this log. I don't know how to put here those from the
        past but here are few.

        The Fall of Hyperion,
        <small style="white-space:nowrap"><i>by Dan Simmons</i></small>
      </h2>
      <p>★★★★★ Same as the first book. Top-notch.</p>

      </h2>
      <p>
        ★★★★★ One of the best science fiction I've read. I re-read the whole
        cycle 2 times in the past and when I made an attempt to start reading
        again I picked the most beloved science fiction I knew. Enjoyed it as
        the first time.
